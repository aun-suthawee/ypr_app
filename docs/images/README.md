# Images Directory

This directory contains screenshots and images used in the project documentation.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-homepage.png`, `strategic-issues-form.png`)
- Compress images before adding them to reduce repository size
- Recommended image width: 800-1200px
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF
- Add alt text when referencing images in documentation
